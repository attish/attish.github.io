## Welcome to my GitHub homepage

My current main project is [a Dynamo-like distributed data
store](https://github.com/attish/bugout-dynamo-concept/bugout-dynamo-concept.html)
implemented entirely in web browser, being as serverless as possible. (Uses
Bittorrent trackers to connect peers.

There is not much else here. Please see [my main GitHub
page](https://github.com/attish/) to know more about me and my projects.

This may change later, though.
