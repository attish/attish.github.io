I am Attila Istv√°n Nagy, a psychiatrist with a passion for coding and AI.

Working as a psychiatry resident, specialist, and since 2019, in my own private
practice allowed me a wonderful opportunity to gain an understanding of the
human cognition and personality. This served me well once my first curious
experiments evolved into AI-enabled tools forming the backbone of the practical
side of my practice. The communication and mentalization skills that are the
most important tools of my trade give me a unique perspective when studying AI
capabilities, comparing their advantages and weaknesses to human abilities, and
ultimately assessing their utility in real-world scenarios.

When working as a psychiatrist, respecting boundaries is paramount, and forms
the basis of the safety and wellbeing of both the patient and the professional.

Ensuring safety is just as crucial in the world of AI. However, while
maintaining professional boundaries in therapy can only be based on respect and
trust, ensuring the integrity of walls and barriers in the way of unethical and
harmful use of AI requires taking an adversarial stance, to intentionally probe
them in a responsible manner. During my initial exploratory work with GPT-3 in
2021, I used the skills gained in my day profession when exploring the limits,
and finding ways to transcend them. Later, as I immersed myself in the field
more intentionally, I came to know that this kind activity is known as red
teaming and is a cornerstone of AI safety.
