I am Attila Istv√°n Nagy, a psychiatrist with a passion for coding and AI.

Working as a psychiatry resident, specialist, and since 2019, in my own private
practice allowed me a wonderful opportunity to gain an understanding of the
human cognition and personality. This served me well once my first curious
experiments evolved into AI-enabled tools forming the backbone of the practical
side of my practice. The communication and mentalization skills that are the
most important tools of my trade give me a unique perspective when studying AI
capabilities, comparing their advantages and weaknesses to human abilities, and
ultimately assessing their utility in real-world scenarios.

In the context of AI, I found my skills gained at work to be readily
utilizable. Prompt engineering is in large part based on the ability
to anticipate how the model would behave - and in this I found that I
am using the same skillset as in human mentalization. I think prompt
engineering work is in a large part about having a 'model of the
model' in your mind, much in the same way as therapeutic work relies
on having a model of the other person's mind.
