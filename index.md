My name is Attila István Nagy, and I am a psychiatrist with a passion for coding and AI.

A previous project is [a Dynamo-like distributed data
store](https://attish.github.io/bugout-dynamo-concept/bugout-dynamo-concept.html)
implemented entirely in web browser, being as serverless as possible. (Uses
Bittorrent trackers to connect peers.

Please see [my main GitHub page](https://github.com/attish/) to know more my other projects.
