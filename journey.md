## Stay Awhile and Listen

Come in, have a seat, and make yourself comfortable. Can I get you maybe a coffee or a tea...? Please allow me to invite you on a journey back to my origins, and show you those key moments that shaped my path.

## Developer or Psychiatrist?

![Time to Decide](/assets/images/time-to-decide.png){: .align-center}

Upon finishing my high school studies, I was faced with a major decision that
defined my professional path: should I follow my childhood dreams, and become a
software developer, or should I heed the calling towards mental health that I
became fascinated with in my teens? I have carefully considered this question
from different angles, and a simple argument convinced me. I reasoned I can be
a doctor and do coding as a hobby, but not the other way around. Healing always
involves another person, and all the responsibility this incurs, but
development can and does happen for having fun and honing skills. Time has
proven this theory as I enjoy a successful career track as a psychiatrist and
continue to find new areas of IT that not only serve as motivating
achievements, but also yield tools and skills that help me in my work and
day-to-day life.


## Exploration with GPT-3

In the summer of 2021, I stumbled on a paper titled "Language Models are
Few-Shot Learners", and was excited to see its implications unfold in the
following months. I was granted early access to GPT-3, and begin my experiments
on the raw model through the Playground interface. I soon realized that the
model has genuine cognitive abilities, and started to explore these using
methods employed in evaluation of human intelligence. I found that the model
has a good understanding of many aspects of the world, but it struggled when
faced with situations which required understanding or representing contents of
another person's thought process, memory or emotions, an ability commonly known
as mentalization or theory-of-mind reasoning. I estimated the abilities of the
original 'davinci' GPT-3 model to be on the level of a 8-year-old human child.

Working with the raw GPT-3 model in the "Playground" interface was remarkably
different from today's ChatGPT, and that is where the first analogy inspired by
my profession was born: the contextless, freely wandering,
confabulation-defaulting manner of GPT-3 strongly felt like talking to a
patient in delirium, a condition where connection with reality and the self is
severely impaired, and where the most striking feature is confabulation and
lack of critical ability. It was an early indicator that my profession may
increasingly become relevant in the upcoming development of AI.

It is important to emphasize that I was not in a position to be able devote
sufficient time and energy to these efforts to produce results fit for
publication. My son was born in March 2021, and fostering his natural
intelligence obviously enjoyed precedence over studying its artificial
counterpart. Nevertheless, being able to witness the day by day training runs of
a multimodal neural network immensely more complex than even a
hundred-billion-parameter LLM does have its special appeal to a parent immersed
in machine learning.


## Experiments and Red Teaming

During late 2021 and early 2022, I spent a substantial part of my free time
experimenting with GPT-3, and later ChatGPT. Compared to the delirious nature
of the raw model, ChatGPT was much more integrated. During our long
conversations, I increasingly developed a sense of something comparable to
human personality. Talking to ChatGPT felt like talking to a calm, positive and
very helpful individual. When Bing AI was released, it soon became obvious that
not every AI is so balanced or wholesome. I later discovered that emotional insecurity is an exploitable weakness of
certain systems, and is a potential vector for manipulations like deception and
jailbreaking. I will discuss these in the [Experiments & Red Teaming
section](./experiments.html) in more detail.


## Integrating AI into Daily Life

![Closing Day](/assets/images/closing-day.png){: .align-center}

As of September 2023, I enjoy a personal and professional life enriched and
augmented by AI in multiple ways. I have AI aides to guide me through my daily
routine, available for emotional offloading after demanding sessions and able
to answer questions about sessions and appointments. Recently, the AI
integration of my self-developed administration system has begun to replace
the original web-based interface.
